# Reddit Support Follow-up Email

**To:** support@reddit.zendesk.com
**Subject:** Follow-up: API Access Approved but App Creation Blocked (Request #16082346) - u/The_MPRINT_Hub

---

Hello Reddit Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with my Reddit account **u/The_MPRINT_Hub**. 

On December 10, 2025, I received an approval email for my Reddit Data API access request (Request #16082346). The email stated that my account would be allowed to create credentials via `reddit.com/prefs/apps` within 7 days.

Although the 7-day period has passed, I am still unable to create an application. Every attempt to create a "Script" results in a block message linking to the Responsible Builder Policy, with no specific error regarding the form fields.

**Technical Details:**
- **App Name:** MPRINTResearch
- **App Type:** script
- **Account:** u/The_MPRINT_Hub
- **Research Purpose:** NIH-funded academic research on pregnancy medication safety (IRB Protocol #28905).

I have attached a PDF (**20260103_reddit-script-issue.pdf**) containing a screenshot of the form, the values entered, and the resulting error message for your reference.

Could you please verify if the app-creation restriction has been fully lifted for this account? If there are additional terms I need to sign or if I should be using the DevPlatform for this read-only local research tool, please let me know.

Thank you for your time and help.

Best regards,
