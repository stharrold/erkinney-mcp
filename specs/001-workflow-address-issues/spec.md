## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the workflow slash commands, I want the documentation to be grammatically correct and professionally polished so that the commands are clear and easy to follow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the `/tasks` command documentation, **When** a user reads the "Next" instruction, **Then** the text should use proper article usage ("create a PR" not "create PR")

### Edge Cases
- N/A - This is a documentation fix with no runtime behavior changes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The `/tasks` command documentation MUST use correct grammar: "to create a PR" instead of "to create PR"
